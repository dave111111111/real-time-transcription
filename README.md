## Features
- **Real-time Voice Activity Detection:** Utilizes Silero VAD to accurately detect when speech is present.
- **Automatic Transcription:** Leverages the Faster-Whisper model to transcribe audio segments efficiently.
- **File Management:** Automatically saves recorded audio files and appends transcriptions to a newly created transcript file for easy organization.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple command-line interface to start recording and manage audio files.
